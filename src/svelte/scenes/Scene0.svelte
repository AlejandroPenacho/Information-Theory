        A Mathematical Theory on Information
    </h3>
    <div>
        Information is such an abstract topic, yet it is used daily by anyone in the world. Information
        is in the radio, in the Internet, in the newspaper, but also in every converstion, every book,
        every sign and everywhere our senses take a role. It can then be a surprise to consider that a
        mathematical theory has been developed to analyze such a variety of scenarios.
