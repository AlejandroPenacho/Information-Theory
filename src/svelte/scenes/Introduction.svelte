        Information theory
    </h3>
    <div class="par">
        Information is such an abstract topic, yet it is used daily by anyone in the world. Information
        is in the radio, in the Internet, in the newspaper, but also in every converstion, every book,
        every sign and everywhere our senses take a role. It can then be a surprise to consider that a
        mathematical theory has been developed to analyze such a variety of scenarios.
    </div>
    <div class="par"> The first lesson of information theory deals with the value of information. But how can
        information be valorated? The winning lottery number of the next week is a more valuable information
        than the previous one, that's for sure. But this kind of value is very subjective: for some people:
        winning the lottery is more important than for other. Subjectiveness can not be analyzed with math.
        Instead, we first have to define clearly what we are talking about when we say
        information.
